# sub-C Compiler
Compiler for a subset of the C programming language. This compiler generates x86 assembly for a correct source program. It also shows various lexical and syntax errors on erroneous source programs. 

# Overview
This is a compiler for a subset of the C programming language. The syntax of the language is similar to C. Although for the sake of simplicity, the syntax, and features of this language is not as versatile as C. The source program can be written in any file, and passed into the compiler executable as you would do with `gcc`.  

The compiler generates x86 assembly files as output, as opposed to directly assembling to target machine code. You can use x86 assemblers to generate executables for your machine, or simulate the x86 assembly using any emulator, a popular tool is `emu8086`.
